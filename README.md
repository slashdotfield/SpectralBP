A Mathematica package for the numerical solution of ODE eigenvalue problems via a pseudospectral method using the Bernstein basis.

## Installation

SpectralBP was developed using Mathematica 11.0.

To install, [download the latest release](https://github.com/slashdotfield/SpectralBP/releases), which is distributed as a paclet file.

Open a Mathematica Notebook, and evaluate

			PacletInstall["dir"]

where dir is the corresponding directory of the downloaded paclet. For example, "C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\SpectralBP-1.0.0.paclet".

Alternatively, one may save the paclet to Mathematica's default notebook directory, which may be found out by running the command \$UserDocumentsDirectory
